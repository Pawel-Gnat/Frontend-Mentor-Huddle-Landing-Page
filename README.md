## My process

I managed to complete this challenge in 5 hours.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I had a hard times with background-size and using flexbox to position my image near headings. I still don't get why sometimes my elements are not inside my div. My social icons where outside media-div (they stayed inside him when I deleted width and height of div, I thought they will auto-resize to my div area). I think I failed to make a good resizing of my main content from mobile to desktop. If I have used css gridd that task would be a way easier, but I wanted to work with my flexbox.
